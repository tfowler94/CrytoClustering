# CrytoClustering

In this challenge we were tasked with predicting if cryptocurrencies are affected by 24-hour or 7-day price changes with Python and unsupervised machine learning.

To prep the data I used StandardScaler from scikit-learn to normalize the data then determined the best k value. From there I clustered the data to plot and then optimized using Principal Component Analysis.
